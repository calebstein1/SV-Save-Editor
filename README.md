# SV Save Editor

SV Save Editor is a simple save file editor for Stardew Valley.
It was originally an ill-fated attempt at fixing a bug in my mod, [Stardew Variable Seasons](https://github.com/calebstein1/StardewVariableSeasons) (check it out!), before I realized manually parsing custom data out of the save file was gonna suck and it would only take like 45 minutes to put all the functionality I needed into an in-game settings panel.
Once that was done, I figured it'd be a shame to let the work done here go _entirely_ to waste and decided it could probably make a pretty decent general purpose save file editor.
At least it can be a much safer way to get infinite money compared to some of the pretty genuinely terrifying tutorials on Reddit teaching how to modify a save file by hand!

Anyway, it doesn't work yet, it reads data fine but saving modified data back isn't implemented yet, so check back soon for that.
