# SVS Season Modifier

I did a bad and pushed a bug into production that may have damaged certain people's Stardew Valley save files if they were using my mod, [Stardew Variable Seasons](https://github.com/calebstein1/StardewVariableSeasons) (go check it out, the bug's since been fixed!)

This tool is meant to rectify the problem by allowing players to manually set the in-game season for their affected save files.
It's still under development at the moment, but it will be releasing in the next few days.
